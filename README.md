# ChargedHiggs Analysis

This is a C++ and ROOT based analysis framework works with NanoAOD. The old MiniAOD version is [here](https://github.com/subirsarkar/HZZ4lAnalysis).
## Codes
All the headers are in `interface` and `src` contains all the source codes.
 - AnaBase : contains kind of all basic functions. All the Branches used in this analysis are accessed here. Basic JobCard parsing is also done in `readJob`.
 - AnaUtil : Basic utilities e.g. histogram filling, cutFlow and efficiency charts.
 - PhysicsObjects : Classes for different objects to make the flat structure into object structure on the fly.
 - PhysicsObjSelector : Object selection
 - MultiLeptonMVAna : main analysis class, contains SR selections.
 - multiLeptonMVAna : main function.

## cloning the repo:
```
git clone https://github.com/gsaha009/ChargedHiggsAnalysis.git
````
Right now, this package can be divided into 2 parts. 

 - Analysis
 - JobCard production

For the Analysis part, the following instucions should be follwed.
###### Getting CMSSW_9_4_9
```
cd ChargedHiggsAnalysis
cmsrel CMSSW_9_4_9
cd CMSSW_9_4_9/src; cmsenv; cd -
```
###### Compile
```
make clean -f *MakefileName*
make cling -f *MakefileName*
make -f *MakefileName*
```
If the codes get compiled successfully, an executable will be produced. Now one would need the JobCards to run the executable i.e. the analysis.
Here comes the 2nd part `MakeJobsAndSend`. It contains a python script which automatize Job Card production and HTCondor submission.
There is also an `yaml` with all relevant information to produce the jobs.
